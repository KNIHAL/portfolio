                <SectionTitle>Where EcoTrack Really Began</SectionTitle>
                <SectionText>
                    EcoTrack didn’t start as a product idea.
                    It started as frustration.
                    <br /><br />
                    I grew up in <b>Hazaribagh, Jharkhand</b> — a city full of potential,
                    but struggling with one visible problem:
                    <br />
                    <i>waste everywhere, no system to manage it.</i>
                    <br /><br />
                    People threw garbage on roads, drains, empty spots.
                    Some waste stayed untouched for an entire week.
                    Mosquitos, smell, pollution — it became part of daily life.
                    <br /><br />
                    And the worst part?
                    <b> There was no proper system for citizens to report it, </b>
                    and no platform for staff or government to coordinate.
                    <br /><br />
                    That’s when EcoTrack was born — not as a startup,
                    but as something I wanted to <b>donate back to my city.</b>

                <SectionTitle>The Problem in My City</SectionTitle>
                <SectionText>
                    Hazaribagh has cleaners, officers, and government staff —
                    but <b>no digital system that connects everyone together. </b>
                    After observing the problem closely, I found major gaps:

                        "Cleaning staff never received real-time location-based tasks",

                    ]}
                />

                <SectionText>
                    EcoTrack became my attempt to build a platform
                    that simplifies reporting and accelerates response.

                <SectionTitle>Why I Built EcoTrack</SectionTitle>
                <SectionText>
                    I kept asking myself:
                    <br />
                    <i>“If we can track food delivery in real time, why not garbage pickup?”</i>
                    <br /><br />
                    EcoTrack was designed with a simple mission:
                    <b> give citizens a voice and give staff visibility.</b>
                    <br /><br />
                    At its core, the platform revolves around two things:

                />

                <SectionText>
                    A small complaint can trigger real action —
                    if the system connects the right people at the right time.

                    EcoTrack connects four types of users:

                    <b>Citizens, Organizations (NGOs), Cleaning Staff, and Admin.</b>
                    <br /><br />
                    Each one gets a tailored experience:

                    I built EcoTrack with a <b>clear intention — donate it to my city. </b>

                    EcoTrack was designed for people who aren’t tech-savvy,
